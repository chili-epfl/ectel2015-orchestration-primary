ISL2014BASELINE - An eyetracking dataset from facilitating secondary geometry lessons
=======================================================

This dataset contains eye-tracking data from a single subject (a researcher), facilitating two geometry lessons in a secondary school classroom, with 11-12 year old students using laptops and a projector. These sessions were recorded in the frame of the [MIOCTI project](http://chili.epfl.ch/miocti).

This dataset has been used in several scientific works, such as the [ECTEL 2015](http://ectel2015.httc.de/) conference paper "Studying Teacher Orchestration Load in Technology-Enhanced Classrooms: A Mixed-method Approach and Case Study", by Luis P. Prieto, Kshitij Sharma, Yun Wen & Pierre Dillenbourg (the analysis and usage of this dataset is available publicly at https://github.com/chili-epfl/ectel2015-orchestration-school)

# Overall structure

Aside from this README.md file, the dataset is composed of three zip archives:

* ISL2014BASELINE-EyetrackingData.zip : Contains the raw datasets from the mobile eyetracker that the teacher was wearing, including eye measures time series, fixation and saccade details (as extracted using SMI's BeGaze 3.4 software).
* ISL2014BASELINE-CodingData.zip : Contains the codes from the manual video coding, by a single researcher, of the 10-second episodes in which the "load index" calculated from eyetracking metrics (see the [ECTEL2015 paper report](https://github.com/chili-epfl/ectel2015-orchestration-school)) had extreme low/high values.
* ISL2014BASELINE-QuestionnaireData.zip : Contains the quantitative and qualitative data from questionnaires: subjective ratings of session workload performed just after the sessions, and "stimulated recall" rating (including semi-transcription and coding of the think-aloud protocol followed) of workload of selected episodes from the sessions. See the method section below for further details.

# Data gathering context and method

The data were gathered in the context of usual technology-enhanced practice in a Swiss International school, in two maths lessons where students used their laptops and Geometer's Sketchpad software to perform exercises on geometry and tessellations, with the teacher orchestrating the lesson (using her own computer and a projector for public display). **Two sessions** of around 80 minutes, with the same teacher and similar activity structures but different cohorts of students were recorded.

The teacher wore a mobile eyetracker (SMI ETG 30Hz), from which eye movement and pupil dilation data were recorded. After each session, the teacher filled in a [NASA TLX](http://humansystems.arc.nasa.gov/groups/tlx/) and another custom questionnaire about the mental workload of the lesson.

Later on, the data from the eye-tracker was exported (using SMI's BeGaze software v3.4), and a "load index" was calculated for each 10-second episode of the three sessions (see the [ECTEL2015 paper report](https://github.com/chili-epfl/ectel2015-orchestration-school) for further details). From this set of 10-second episodes we selected those that had minimum (0) or maximum (4) cognitive load index, and performed a qualitative video coding of them, to assess the main trends/patterns in orchestration properties of high/low load episodes, regarding: the activity or intervention the teacher was performing, the social plane at which the activity was intended and the main focus of the teacherâ€™s gaze during the episode. More details about the context and method used can be found in [Prieto et al. (2014)](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2669543).

From these "extreme load episodes", a subset of 20 episodes was selected (from spans of sustained high- or low-load), and a post-hoc stimulated recall interview was conducted with the teacher. In the interview, the teacher rated these selected episodes in a subjective 1-9 scale for mental effort, using a think-aloud protocol to explain the rationale of her subjective ratings. The audio from this think-aloud protocol was semi-transcribed (only the spans of interesting information were transcribed) and open coded by a single researcher.

_Note : Neither the subjective video feed recorded during the lesson, or the audio file from the think-aloud protocol are provided within this dataset, for anonymity reasons._
